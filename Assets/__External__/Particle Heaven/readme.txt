Tired of those same old particle textures?



This package provides you with an extensive set of unique textures for your project's particle effects!

- 200 unique textures

- 200 predefined materials in 10 categories (Acids, Alien Blood, Blood, Dust, Fire, Green Goo, Magic, Others, Sci Fi, Smoke, Steam) 

- Dozens of prepared, easy-to-use particle effects
